# BookingService
A small service for booking timeslots. I made this entirely for my own learning, as well as to demonstrate my code as a part 
of my portfolio.
My goal is to make this use a rabbitMQ instance to send booking requests to a confirmation service in the form of json,
which `ConfirmationService` will consume.
